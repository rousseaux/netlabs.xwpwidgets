     *@@ XCENTERGLOBALS:
     *      global data for a running XCenter instance.
     *      This is created once per open XCenter.
     *
     *      A pointer to this one structure exists in each
     *      XCENTERWIDGET instance so that the widgets
     *      can access some of the data of the XCenter
     *      they belong to.
     *
     *      In this structure, an XCenter instance
     *      passes a number of variables to its member
     *      widgets so that they can access some things
     *      more quickly for convenience. This structure
     *      is fully initialized at the time the widgets
     *      are created, but values may change while the
     *      XCenter is open (e.g. if the user changes
     *      view settings in the XCenter settings notebook).
     *
     *      "Globals" isn't really a good name since
     *      one of these structures is created for
     *      each open XCenter (and there can be several),
     *      but this is definitely more global than the
     *      widget-specific structures.

     *
     *         The first thing the widget _must_ do on WM_CREATE
     *         is to store the XCENTERWIDGET pointer (from mp1)
     *         in its QWL_USER window word by calling:

     *         with V0.9.11 (2001-04-25) [umoeller] to avoid
     *         conflicts with the WPS menu item IDs, sorry.
     *
     *      <B>Resource management</B>
     *
     *      You should always be aware that your widget is a PM
     *      window in the WPS process. As a result, all resource
     *      leaks that you produce in your widget code will affect
     *      the entire WPS, and all crashes will too.
     *
     *      As a general rule, the XCenter will free all widget
     *      resources that it has allocated itself (such as the
     *      structures that were created for it). By contrast,
     *      if you allocate something yourself, it is your
     *      responsibility to free it. This applies especially
     *      to XCENTERWIDGET.pUser, which is your general pointer
     *      to store widget-specific things.
     *
     *      Of course the same rules apply to PM resources such
     *      as icons, bitmaps, regions, memory PS's etc. You can
     *      quickly bring down the WPS if you forget to free those.
     *      Same thing if you start additional threads in your
     *      widget code.
     *
     *      This is especially important because widget windows
     *      can be created and destroyed without the widgets
     *      cooperation. For example, if the widget is in a tray,
     *      it will be created and destroyed when the current
     *      tray changes. If you leak something in this situation,
     *      this can quickly become a major problem.
     *
     *      I also recommend to use exception handling in your
     *      widget code to properly clean up things if something
     *      goes wrong. As said in center.c, do not use exit
     *      lists because that will cause DLL unloading to fail.
     *
     *      <B>Tooltip support</B>
     *
     *      If your widget class has the WGTF_TOOLTIP flag set,
     *      it will receive WM_CONTROL with TTN_* notifications
     *      and the source window ID set to ID_XCENTER_TOOLTIP.
     *      If it responds to TTN_NEEDTEXT, it must fill the
     *      TOOLTIPTEXT pointed to by mp2. See include\helpers\comctl.h
     *      for details.
     *
     *      In addition, the widget will also receive the TTN_SHOW
     *      and TTN_POP notifications when the tooltip is being
     *      shown or hidden above it.
     *
     *      <B>Trayable widgets</B>
     *
     *      If your widget is supposed to be trayable (i.e.
     *      the WGTF_TRAYABLE flag is set in the XCENTERWIDGETCLASS),
     *      it must conform to a few extra rules:
     *
     *      -- Trayable widgets cannot be sizeable or greedy
     *         because the tray widget itself is sizeable.
     *
     *      -- You must never assume that the parent window of
     *         your widget really is the XCenter client. It can
     *         also be a tray widget. Always use
     *         WinQueryWindow(hwndWidget, QW_PARENT) to find your
     *         parent window, which will properly give you either
     *         the XCenter client or the tray widget.
     *
     *      -- If you use XCM_* messages, never post them to the
     *         XCenter client window (whose handle is available
     *         thru XCENTERGLOBALS). All XCM_* essages are understood
     *         by the tray widget also, and if your widget is in a tray,
     *         it must post them to the tray instead of the client.
     *
     *      -- Your widget must be prepared for being created or
     *         destroyed at times other than XCenter creation or
     *         destruction because the tray widget will do this
     *         when the current tray is switched.
